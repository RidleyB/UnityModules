To Implement:

- Ensure resources are under a resources folder, so the system can find them.
- The LoadResourceAttribute won't be found by the Injector unless the class it's used in implements IResourceLoader.
- The path for the Attribute starts from: "Resources/"
- Example:

public class MyTestResourceLoader : MonoBehaviour, IResourceLoader
{
      [LoadResource("myTestResource")]
      public GameObject myResource;
}

Note:
- This is an early implementation, I plan on allowing the user to choose at which point the injection occurs.
